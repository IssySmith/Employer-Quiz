# Employer-Quiz
Please use Python version 3.9 or above to complete your assignment. Note that
Python 3.9+ cannot be used on Windows 7 and earlier. Please state the Python
version you used to complete this assignment.
Your task is to write a 2,000-word report based on a project you have developed and
presented in a README file located at the root of a remote code repository. The
project should demonstrate designing, coding, testing, deploying and documenting a
quiz. The quiz should be intended for use by your employer. It could test mathematical
knowledge (such as identifying square numbers or solving linear equations) or
organisational expertise (such as policies, procedures, or ethical practices). The goal

is to follow a professional development process that utilises current programming
techniques, stores code in GitHub, adds features incrementally, applies testing and
continuous integration, and provides both user and technical documentation. You must
use Python to build the project, along with any appropriate frameworks such as
Tkinter, Streamlit or Flask.
The system you develop must have the following features:
1. A GUI to facilitate the input, viewing, and exporting of data.
2. Persistent data storage with functionality to read from and write to a CSV file or
similar permanent format.
3. Implementation using some object-oriented programming principles.
4. Comprehensive code documentation, including descriptive docstrings.
5. Exception handling and input validation.
6. Testable logic, exemplified by pure functions for input validation that
consistently return the same output given the same parameters.
A report should be in the form of a README, and it should contain the following parts:
1. Introduction
2. Design Section
3. Development Section
4. Testing Section
5. Documentation Section (User and Technical)
6. Evaluation Section

# Introduction
Provide a concise overview of your workplace environment and explain the
relevance of your proposed MVP to your employer. (300 words +/- 20%)

# Design
This section has no word limit and may include bullet-pointed lists, tables and images.
• A GUI Design using Figma or another prototyping tool. Include screenshots and
(optionally) a link. The design should be specific to your application and show
the planned user journey.
• Functional and Non-functional Requirements. Clearly outline what your
application must do and how it should perform.
• A Tech Stack Outline. Briefly describe the languages, libraries, tools, and
storage methods you plan to use.
• A Code Design Document. Provide a class diagram or similar documentation
to illustrate your code design.

# Development
In this section, include relevant code blocks using triple backticks (```) to format your code clearly. Explain how your application works by describing the main parts of your code, such as important functions, classes, or modules. Provide enough detail to demonstrate your understanding of how each part contributes to the overall functionality. There is no word limit; focus on clarity and completeness.

# Testing
Explain your approach to testing your digital product, demonstrating a systematic and
strategic approach. Address the following topics:
1. Testing strategy and methodology (summarise and justify different methods of
testing you have used, for example, manual and automated unit testing)
2. Outcomes of application testing:\
2.1. The outcome of manual tests (should be presented in a tabular
format).\
2.2. Unit testing outcome (should include screenshots of tests running passing or failing).

# Documentation 
User documentation should explain how end users, such as staff within your
organisation, can interact with the quiz application, whereas technical documentation
should outline steps such as running tests locally and explain parts of the code.

## User

## Technical

# Evaluation
The evaluation section should explain what went well during the development of the
project and what could have been improved. The evaluation section should be written
in a genuine, reflective tone. As the README follows the conventions of software
documentation, hyperlinks should be used for references instead of Harvard
referencing.

# PLAN
- Create mural and make idea of what is needed
- Create figma to design
- On mural: Create class diagram, Flow chart
- Write introduction on what it is and why the employer needs it
- Write out design
    - Add requirements
    - Add flow chart of usage 
    - Add class diagram
    - Add Figma GUI Design
    - Add tech stack outline
