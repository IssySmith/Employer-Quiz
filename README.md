# Introduction
Workplace security is becoming increasingly important, where every employee must keep a level of security to ensure the company's details don't get leaked to competitors or even hackers who could steal money or ruin the ruputation of the company. Therefore this quiz is made for employees at IBM to check their understanding of security, and to record their answers so if they score low their manager can ensure they get the necessary education to keep IBM safe.

# Design 

## Initial Design 
To help me ideate with my ideas for the app, I first created a mural to act as a 'brain dump' to help me plan out what my program will include and when, this is represented by the image below:

## Figma Design
To Design what my interface would look like, I created a Figma prottype with the main screens that will be on my interface, as well as the flows between them:

## Tech Stack Outline
My backend code is using **Python**, this is what I have been using this module and I am comfortable coding with it but also want to experience importing the classes or functipns as it is somehting I would use in work.

To create my GUI, I decided to use **Streamlit**. At first I was going to use Tkinter as I have some previous use of coding with it. However, what changed my mind was after speaking with people I work with they recommend I use Streamlit as it is something they have sometimes used in work and would be useful to understand.
